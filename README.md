# Pumping_Test_Interpretation_with_Python
This is a Python (version 2 or 3) script to aid in the interpretation of aquifer pumping tests using the Theis (1935) and Hantush and Jacob (1955) solutions for confined and leaky confined aquifers, respectively, as well as a simple numerical method-of-lines solution for an unconfined aquifer with wellbore storage.
